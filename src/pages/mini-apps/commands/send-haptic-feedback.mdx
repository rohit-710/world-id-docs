# Send Haptic Feedback

Send Haptic Feedback is our command that lets you create more immersive experiences, by providing tactile feedback to users.

Haptic feedback can improve the user experience by:

-   **Enhancing Responsiveness**: Immediate tactile feedback makes interactions feel faster and more satisfying.
-   **Improving Accessibility**: Haptics can help users with visual impairments by providing an additional layer of feedback.
-   **Increasing Engagement**: Users are more likely to enjoy and continue using apps that feel interactive and responsive.
